                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
                It is used to design web pages using a markup
                language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext
                and Markup language. Hypertext defines the
                link between the web pages. A markup language
                is used to define the text document within tag
                which defines the structure of web pages.
                HTML is a markup language that is used by the
                browser to manipulate text, images, and other
                content to display it in the required format.

            <p class="text-small">
                C is a procedural programming language. It
                was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie
                as a system programming language to write
                operating system. The main features of C
                language include low-level access to memory,
                simple set of keywords, and clean style,
                these features make C language suitable for
                system programming like operating system or
                compiler development.
